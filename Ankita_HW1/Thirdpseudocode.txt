'''
Define an array (200x200) with value 0 at every position.

Define step choices in four perpendicular directions of unit 1 and store them in a list.

We make value of the array at the center[100,100]=1.

The walks start from the center as well.

If the position is occupied (a[Pos]=1), the walker takes a step randomly in any direction.

It does so until it finds a position unoccupied (a[Pos]=0), at that moment it attaches itself there.

Once it attaches, we generate a new walker from the center[100,100] again.

If walker hits the boundary, it will take a step back.

Since, the walker starts everytime from the centre and it has an equal probability to move in any direction, it does move uniformly to form a circle.
