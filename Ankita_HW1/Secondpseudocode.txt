'''
Define an array (200x200) with value 0 at every position.

Define step choices in four perpendicular directions of unit 1 and store them in a list.

We make the value of the array at center of the bottom[199,100]=1 or the entire bottom[199,]=1

The walks start from a random position on the top.

It keeps moving by taking random steps till it finds an occupied position (either the center of the bottom or the entire bottom).

Once it finds a position where the value in the array is 1, it attaches itself there.

We generate 4000 such random walkers from the top which attach themselves to the growing structure at the bottom.

We get a pretty coral like image.
