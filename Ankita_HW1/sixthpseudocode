"""
We have three individual codes: sixth_a.py, sixth_b.py and sixth_i.py which calculate the fractal dimension for DLA, DLA from bottom and DLA inside out respectively.

We run them each on the cluster using a shell script, subWalkerSingle.sh

We run each code thousand times on the cluster using the following command:
for range in {1..1000}; do qsub subWalkerSingle.sh;done

We concatenate 1000 output files for each DLA using the following command:
cat DLA.o* > output

For each of the structure, we get an output file hence, DLA:sixth_a.py:output
                                                        DLA from bottom:sixth_b.py:output_b
                                                        DLA inside out:sixth_i.py:output_i

We can run mean.py to obtain values of mean and standard deviation and boxplot.py to get boxplots.

We have two boxplots: DLAnDLA_bottom.png and DLA_insideout.png for DLA and DLA from bottom structures and DLA inside out respectively.
