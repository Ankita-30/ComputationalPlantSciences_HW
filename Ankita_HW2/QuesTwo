We make the picture black and white. 
Then we make it such that only line joining middle points of each block is left. 
So, we get a number of not joined lines.
Lines are one and rest is not one. 
We go through the entire picture and get total no. of ones. 
Then we get total no. of lines. 
To know how long each line is or the mean, we part total no. of ones by the number of lines.
